AnalyseMail
===========

1) Get social profile from any mail ID. Currently gets from gravatar (fb, twitter, linkedin), Cruchbase, Klout. 

2) Get sentiment of a mail (positive, negative). 

3) combine both the above and provide a priority for any email. (High, low, average etc).

TODO:

Add more sources for email looks.
